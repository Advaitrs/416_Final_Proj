Narrative Structure:
The narrative visualization is designed as an interactive slide show. Users can click on the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through different years (scenes) and observe how the COVID-19 case count changes over time. Additionally, users can select a political party from the dropdown menu to filter the data and see the impact of each party on the COVID-19 case count.

Visual Structure:
Each scene in the interactive slide show consists of two main visualizations: the bar chart displaying COVID-19 cases by state and the correlation plot showing the relationship between COVID-19 cases and state population. The bar chart uses color (blue for Democratic and red for Republican) to highlight the party affiliation of each state, making it easy for viewers to focus on the political aspect. The correlation plot uses dots with different colors to distinguish between Democratic and Republican states, aiding in understanding the correlation between cases and population size.

Scenes and Ordering:
The scenes in the narrative visualization represent each year from 2020 to 2023. The ordering is chronological, allowing users to observe how COVID-19 cases evolve over time. The user can click through the scenes using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons or select a specific year from the dropdown menu.

Annotations:
The visualization provides tooltips that appear when hovering over the bars in the bar chart or the dots in the correlation plot. These tooltips display information about the state, COVID-19 cases, and population, enhancing the viewer's understanding of the data.

Parameters and States:
The parameters of the narrative visualization are the years (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023) and the political party filter (all, Democratic, Republican). Each scene represents a specific year with its corresponding data, and the state of the visualization changes based on the selected year and party filter.

Triggers and Affordances:
The triggers in the narrative visualization are the buttons ("Next," "Previous," and "Go Back to Start") and the dropdown menu. Clicking on these triggers updates the current scene (year) and filters the data accordingly, providing users with the available options to explore the visualization.
